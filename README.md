# Sum4Me.AI

## Inspiration
Sum4Me.AI was born from recognizing three key challenges in modern workplace meetings:
1. Information overload during meetings makes it difficult to capture all important details
2. Critical decisions and action items often get lost in lengthy recordings
3. Important insights fade without proper reinforcement and follow-up

We saw an opportunity to transform these challenges into advantages through AI-powered meeting analysis and interactive learning.

* AI-generated meeting summaries
* Automated action item extraction
* Sentiment analysis with visual feedback
* Optional timestamp support

### 3. Interactive Learning
* Auto-generated quizzes from meeting content
* Multiple difficulty levels
* Detailed answer explanations
* Progress tracking
* Downloadable quiz results

### 4. Meeting Management
